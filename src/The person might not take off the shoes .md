The person might not take off the shoes the robot has to recheck and make sure
The robot starts inside of the arena
Once the check is done the person stops breaking the rules
The forbidden room has to leave the arena
How high is the penalty for wrong shoes
The test is mainly about identifying people
Asking if someone is breaking the rules is dangerous because people might lie
If you're detecting something on the floor, you must tell the person what they must pick up 
Point or show an item, or push it
Will the bin be open?
If you find a guest without a drink, the drink is at the default location which is the cabinet
forbidden room is on the github
A person can start breaking a rule suddenly
what is trash?
the objects that are on the floor that need to be picked up are known objects from the known list
Who will be the guest in the room?
Where do the guests have to take of the shoes? entrance or area marked
Near the entrance 
The referee will be following all of the rules
People that are not following the rules are going to be in the center of the arena or on the borders?
People outside the arena should be ignored
Only penalty for incriminating innocent people
Talking to a wall has no penalty
If the robot does not detect a drink? can the robot ask the person to show the drink, they might not follow them. The robot must tell them to show their hands and feeet


EGPSR:
New this year: Similarly to stickler for the rules there are problems in the arena that the robot has to find. The robot enters through the door and then it has to find problems setup for it, objects not at the default loction. EGPSR items can be anything,  there is alwasy 2 people who need assitance calling for the robots and the robot approaches them and gets points for doing the command. Do people cooperate? They do! As long as they are clear and concise and easy to understand. Mainly two problems. First: taking out the trash. Every object has an assigned category and every category has an assigned location. If you find a known object on the floor, you can bring it on the bin or to the default location, if it's not known it's trash and must be taken to the trash.
Commands generated for a command generator like gpsr, you can use qr codes, (speech can be bypassed).
You get points for both understanding the command and executing the command. Find and clearly state a problem gives points, if you then solve, you get points for solving the problem. You can ask for assistance from the refereee and get a point reduction according to the referee decision. Will the arena be setup for all problems in advance or is this a one term, especially important for commands given to the people. 2 People will be standing at the designed position already, commands for the people are.
Are we allowed to ask for a problem and solve it later on? Yeah, it's fine, you cannot use the. You can assume a command is setup.
Time keeps running at all times.
An accepted strategy would be getting all of the problems and then solve them.
Any specific remark regarding people? Do they wait anywhere? waving? Where the robot is anywhere in the house or if the robot is near them
If the robot is looking at you, you wave. Don't tell people elsewhere to wave.
Penalties for assistance are discussed afterwards.
Regarding the waving, in the rulebook it says the robot will raise their hand if the person is in the same room?
The person will only wave if the robot is in the same room and looking at them.
For restaurant it will be somewhere on this site wait 
Allways robots waiting, where carry my luggage with electricity available
Everyone waits in carry my luggage then three of the robots are taken to the restaurant but on the way there might not be power.
NO mapping, the next team for running the test setups the last.
For restaurant the robot will be having a bar and the bartender 
If the bartender has to leave their place there is a penalty
You have to find the barkeeper, we don't know where it is.
The setup will be changed.
For this test it says the robot needs to be very carefull so they are more strict with bumping.
If you want to use the attached tray you go to the waiting point with the tray already attached
To get points for founding someone you have to find them and point at them or show it in the table.
Testing there in advance will be allowed? Yes. The area will be rearanged tomorrow
If you have a microphone, it can be used during restaurant
The guests are somewhere close or far
There are many guests visible from the starting point
This test can be biased by instructions or the orders
For this test it's possible that if there are members they can give them instructions
If the robot is very clear in it's instructions and the person doesn't understand, then the referee will intervene
The unattached tray bonus points
The barman is near the starting position, will there be more than one person?
It's possible that there is other people standing around.
Does the robot need to tell the people to exagerate their waves?
Tell the guests to wave for the robot.
It's the same as for objects, you need to show the scene and show the person sitting in the bounding box of the person
Can we still get points if the person puts objects inside of the tray?
There is a penalty for asking the barman to leave the table?
To get speech points you have to tell the barman
In Egpsr the 2 people with commands for the robot will wave and no one else
Lying is fine in stickler for the rules
As soon as you get a request the place is setup
There are 2 teams waiting for the other robot participating in the restaurant.
